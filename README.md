# Windows Promela and jSpin Setup
1) Download "Spin" folder and place it somewhere.

2) If you don't already have it, download and install [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) (thats the font I set it to - if you want to set your own font/font size, edit config.cfg's FONT_SIZE and FONT_FAMILY).

3) Add the "Spin/bin" folder to your environment variables>PATH.

4) Reboot.

5) Put a shortcut to "Spin/spin.exe" on your desktop for convenience.
