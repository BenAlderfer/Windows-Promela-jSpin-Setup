# Windows Promela and jSpin Setup
1) Download "Spin" folder and place it somewhere.

2) If you don't already have it, download and install [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) (thats the font I set it to - if you want to set your own font/font size, edit config.cfg's FONT_SIZE and FONT_FAMILY).

3) Add the "Spin\bin" folder to your environment variables>PATH. To do this, go to "Control Panel\System and Security\System" and click "Advanced system settings" then "Environment Variables...". Then in the "System Variables" section, find "Path", click "Edit..." and add the location to the folder at the end (ex. - C:\Spin\bin\).

4) Reboot.

5) Put a shortcut to "Spin\spin.exe" on your desktop for convenience.
