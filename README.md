# Windows Promela and jSpin Setup
1) Download "Spin" folder and place it somewhere.

2) If you don't already have it, download and install [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) (that is the font I set the editor to use - if you don't like it, change it yourself).

3) Add both the "Spin" folder and "Spin/bin" folder to your environmental variables>PATH (bin is needed, root folder may not be but it works).

4) Reboot.

5) Put a shortcut to "spin.exe" on your desktop for convenience.
